Tag information acquisition and processing
------------------------------------------
Q1.  What is the format of Tag data and in which file it is?
Ans: The tag file "user_taggedartists.dat" contains the name of the tag and a corresponding tag id.
Ex: 
userID	artistID	tagID	day	month	year
1	2	52	13	1	4	2009

Q2. How many of them and how much used and why?
Ans: We have used 1000 tags because most of them were inchorent such as the name of the album or some non-english words.
such as:
1191	ahhhhhhhhh
1196	wow
1802	nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

Q3. Give an example of some removed tags (with garbage meaning).
Ans: There were many repetitions For ex: 80's  rock and 80 rock

Q4. Which formula has been used to calculate it?
Ans: Eq. number (18) & (19) in the paper was used.

Time information acquisition and processing
-------------------------------------------
Q1. What is the format of Time data and from which file it is fetched?
Ans: It is residing in "user_taggedartists.dat"
Ex: 
userID	artistID	tagID	day	month	year
1	2	52	13	1	4	2009

Q2. How to fetch these data:
Ans: We have converted this data to year format and then applied it on the formula.

Q3. How many of them are there and how much you have used and why?
Ans: The users that we took out at random, we took the artists they taggeed and all the other information with it.

Q4. Give example of the used time data:
Ans: While calculating the decay factor we used the difference of the year in our formulation. 
Example:  {current year(2015) - x}, where 'x' is the year that in which the artist was tagged by the user.
Score given in 2012 is: 5
Calculating in 2015: = (5) * (0.9)^(2015-2012)
Here, 5 is rating in 2012 and 0.9 is decaying factor.
